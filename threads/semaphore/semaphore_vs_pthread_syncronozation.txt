1. **Semaphores**:
   - **Behavior**: Semaphores can be used for more complex synchronization scenarios beyond mutual exclusion, such as signaling and controlling access to multiple instances of a resource.
   - **Types**: Semaphores can be binary (mutex-like) or counting (general-purpose) based on their behavior and usage.
   - **Wait Mechanism**: `sem_wait()` decrements the semaphore value and blocks if the value is negative until it becomes positive.
   - **Post Mechanism**: `sem_post()` increments the semaphore value and wakes up waiting threads if necessary.
   - **Flexibility**: Semaphores provide more flexibility in synchronization compared to mutexes and spinlocks.

2. **pthread_mutex**:
   - **Behavior**: Mutexes are primarily used for mutual exclusion to ensure only one thread accesses a shared resource at a time.
   - **Block on Attempt**: A thread attempting to lock a mutex will block until the mutex is available.
   - **Deadlock Avoidance**: Mutexes offer deadlock avoidance mechanisms like prioritized locking and error-checking capabilities.
   - **Lock Ownership**: Mutexes are locked and unlocked by the same thread, ensuring lock ownership and providing safety features.

3. **pthread_spinlock**:
   - **Spin vs. Block**: Spinlocks busy-wait (spin) until the lock is available instead of blocking, which can be more efficient in low-contention scenarios.
   - **Performance**: Spinlocks are lightweight and useful for short critical sections where the thread won't be preempted.
   - **Contention Impact**: Spinlocks are not suitable for high-contention scenarios as they can waste CPU cycles while spinning.

In summary:
- **Semaphores** are more general-purpose and versatile, allowing for both synchronization and signaling.
- **Mutexes** are best suited for mutual exclusion with additional features like deadlock avoidance.
- **Spinlocks** are lightweight and efficient for low-contention scenarios but may not be suitable for high-contention situations.
